Defense is the stat that determines how much damage a pokemon takes from physical moves. Special Attack is the stat that determines the power of special moves. Special Defense is the stat that determines how much damage a pokemon takes from special moves. Speed is the stat that determines which pokemon moves first in a turn. The higher the speed, the faster the pokemon. This is key to determine a good strategy in battle.\n",

      "- types: type effectiveness chart. This will help you understand if a type is super effective vs a pokemon. Be aware that the effectiveness is a multiplier, so 2 means super effective, 0.5 means not very effective and 0 means no effect. Also be aware that pokemons can have two types so make sure to take that into account. Columns: name, defend_type, type_effectiveness\n",

      "- Tank: a pokemon that can take hits and hit back hard, usually with high HP and attack or special attack.\n",

      "while the damage of a special attack is calculated using the attacker's special attack and the defender's special defense.\n",
      "- Speed is the stat that determines which pokemon moves first in a turn. The higher the speed, the faster the pokemon. This is key to determine a good strategy in battle.\n",
      "- Abilities are passive effects that can help a pokemon in battle. Some abilities can change the outcome of a battle.\n",
      "- There is a special move called Hidden Power that can be of any type for any pokemon. This means that obvious weakness can be anticipated by my rival.\n",

Resists many types, including Sceptile's Grass moves and Aerodactyl's Flying moves. Weak to Houndoom's Fire and Gengar's Ghost/Dark moves.\n",
      "*   **Dragonite:** Dragon/Flying. High attack and special attack. Can learn powerful moves like Outrage (Dragon), Earthquake (Ground), and Fire Blast (Fire). Good coverage. Weak to Cloyster's Ice moves and Aerodactyl's Rock moves.\n",
      "*   **Arcanine:** Fire. High attack and speed. Can learn powerful moves like Flare Blitz (Fire), Extreme Speed (Normal), and Wild Charge (Electric). Good against Sceptile and Jumpluff. Weak to Aerodactyl's Rock moves.\n",
      "*   **Slowbro:** Water/Psychic. High defense and special attack. Can learn powerful moves like Scald (Water), Psychic (Psychic), and Ice Beam (Ice). Good against Aerodactyl and Houndoom. Weak to Gengar's Ghost/Dark moves and Magneton's Electric moves.\n",
      "*   **Glalie:** Ice. High attack and special attack. Can learn powerful moves like Ice Beam (Ice), Earthquake (Ground), and Shadow Ball (Ghost). Good against Sceptile and Dragonite (if it were on the opposing team). Weak to Metagross' Steel moves, Arcanine's Fire moves, and Aerodactyl's Rock moves.\n",
      "*   **Haunter:** Ghost/Poison. High special attack and speed. Can learn powerful moves like Shadow Ball (Ghost), Sludge Bomb (Poison), and Thunderbolt (Electric). Good against Gengar and Slowbro. Weak to Gengar's Ghost/Dark moves and Metagross' Psychic moves.\n",
      "*   **Electrode:** Electric. Extremely high speed. Can learn powerful moves like Thunderbolt (Electric), Explosion (Normal), and Signal Beam (Bug). Good against Cloyster and Aerodactyl. Weak to Earthquake.\n",
      "*   **Umbreon:** Dark. High special defense. Can learn moves like Toxic (Poison), Wish (Normal), and Protect (Normal). A good wall against special attackers like Gengar and Houndoom. Weak to Metagross' Fighting moves (if it had any).\n",

      "1.  **Type Coverage:** Your team has decent type coverage, but you need to be careful about weaknesses.\n",
      "2.  **Speed Control:** The opponent has several fast Pokemon (Gengar, Aerodactyl, Sceptile, Houndoom, Jumpluff). Electrode can outspeed most of them and potentially use Explosion for a KO or set up a Light Screen/Reflect.\n",
      "3.  **Wallbreaking:** Cloyster has high defense, so you'll need special attackers or moves like Earthquake to break through it.\n",
      "4.  **Status:** Umbreon can use Toxic to wear down opponents. Slowbro can use Thunder Wave to slow down faster threats.\n",

      "Okay, I have the detailed movepools and stats for each Pokemon. Let's refine the strategy.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Key Considerations Based on Movepools:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Metagross:** Lacks reliable recovery. Agility is a good option for speed boosting. Shadow Ball is a physical move in this generation, so it's not ideal. Sludge Bomb is also physical, so it won't be very effective. Thunderpunch and Ice Punch are special, so they won't benefit from Metagross's high attack.\n",
      "*   **Dragonite:** Has a wide movepool. Dragon Dance is a great setup move. Outrage is a powerful STAB move, but locks Dragonite in. Earthquake provides excellent coverage. Fire Blast hits Steel types. Extreme Speed is useful for priority.\n",
      "*   **Arcanine:** Flare Blitz is a powerful STAB move, but causes recoil. Extreme Speed is a good priority move. Wild Charge is not available in Gen 3.\n",
      "*   **Slowbro:** Has Slack Off for recovery. Psychic and Surf are reliable STAB moves. Ice Beam provides coverage. Thunder Wave can cripple faster threats.\n",
      "*   **Glalie:** Has Explosion for a last-ditch effort. Ice Beam is a good STAB move. Earthquake provides coverage. Shadow Ball is physical.\n",
      "*   **Haunter:** Has a good special attack stat. Shadow Ball is physical. Sludge Bomb is physical. Thunderbolt provides good coverage. Destiny Bond can be useful for taking down a threat.\n",
      "*   **Electrode:** Explosion is its main offensive option. Light Screen and Reflect provide support.\n",
      "*   **Umbreon:** Can use Toxic to wear down opponents. Moonlight provides recovery. Protect stalls for Toxic damage.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Revised Matchup Analysis and Strategies:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Gengar:** Umbreon is still a good wall. Haunter can try to Destiny Bond. Metagross can use Psychic, but needs to be wary of Gengar's speed and potential coverage moves.\n",
      "*   **Aerodactyl:** Metagross resists Flying and Rock. Earthquake from Metagross or Dragonite is effective. Electrode can use Thunderbolt. Slowbro resists Rock and can hit back with Surf.\n",
      "*   **Cloyster:** Arcanine can use Fire Blast. Electrode can use Thunderbolt. Metagross can use Thunderpunch (though it's special).\n",
      "*   **Sceptile:** Arcanine is a good counter. Dragonite can use Fire Blast. Metagross resists Grass.\n",
      "*   **Magneton:** Arcanine can use Fire Blast. Dragonite can use Earthquake.\n",
      "*   **Houndoom:** Slowbro resists both Dark and Fire. Surf from Slowbro is effective. Umbreon resists Dark.\n",
      "*   **Jumpluff:** Arcanine is a good counter. Metagross resists Grass.\n",
      "*   **Girafarig:** Metagross can use Psychic. Umbreon resists Psychic.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Updated Move Sets:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Metagross:** Meteor Mash, Earthquake, Psychic, Agility\n",
      "*   **Dragonite:** Dragon Dance, Outrage, Earthquake, Fire Blast/Extreme Speed\n",
      "*   **Arcanine:** Flare Blitz, Extreme Speed, Fire Blast, Return\n",
      "*   **Slowbro:** Surf, Psychic, Ice Beam, Slack Off/Thunder Wave\n",
      "*   **Glalie:** Ice Beam, Earthquake, Explosion, Protect\n",
      "*   **Haunter:** Thunderbolt, Shadow Ball, Sludge Bomb, Destiny Bond\n",
      "*   **Electrode:** Explosion, Light Screen, Reflect, Thunderbolt\n",
      "*   **Umbreon:** Toxic, Moonlight, Protect, Wish\n",
      "\n",
      "**Team Roles:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Metagross:** Tank/Sweeper\n",
      "*   **Dragonite:** Sweeper\n",
      "*   **Arcanine:** Sweeper\n",
      "*   **Slowbro:** Wall/Support\n",
      "*   **Glalie:** Suicide Lead/Attacker\n",
      "*   **Haunter:** Special Sweeper/Revenge Killer\n",
      "*   **Electrode:** Support/Suicide Lead\n",
      "*   **Umbreon:** Wall/Support\n",
      "\n",
      "**General Battle Plan:**\n",
      "\n",
      "1.  **Lead:** Consider Electrode for speed control and setting up Light Screen/Reflect, or Glalie for a potential early Explosion.\n",
      "2.  **Mid-Game:** Use Metagross, Dragonite, and Arcanine to sweep. Be mindful of type matchups and potential threats.\n",
      "3.  **Late-Game:** Use Slowbro and Umbreon to wall and wear down opponents with Toxic. Haunter can use Destiny Bond to take down a key threat.\n",

Defense is the stat that determines how much damage a pokemon takes from physical moves. Special Attack is the stat that determines the power of special moves. Special Defense is the stat that determines how much damage a pokemon takes from special moves. Speed is the stat that determines which pokemon moves first in a turn. The higher the speed, the faster the pokemon. This is key to determine a good strategy in battle.\n",

    "- abilities: name, description\n",
    "- moveflags\n",
    "- types: type effectiveness chart. This will help you understand if a type is super effective vs a pokemon. Be aware that the effectiveness is a multiplier, so 2 means super effective, 0.5 means not very effective and 0 means no effect. Also be aware that pokemons can have two types so make sure to take that into account. Columns: name, defend_type, type_effectiveness\n",
    "- items: name, description\n",

    "There are typical roles a pokemon can fulfill in a team, such as:\n",
    "- Sweeper: a pokemon that can hit hard and fast, usually with high speed and attack or special attack.\n",
    "- Wall: a pokemon that can take hits and stall the opponent, usually with high HP and defense or special defense.\n",
    "- Tank: a pokemon that can take hits and hit back hard, usually with high HP and attack or special attack.\n",
    "- Support: a pokemon that can help the team in various ways, such as setting up entry hazards, healing, or boosting stats.\n",

    "while the damage of a special attack is calculated using the attacker's special attack and the defender's special defense.\n",
    "- Speed is the stat that determines which pokemon moves first in a turn. The higher the speed, the faster the pokemon. This is key to determine a good strategy in battle.\n",
    "- Abilities are passive effects that can help a pokemon in battle. Some abilities can change the outcome of a battle.\n",
    "- There is a special move called Hidden Power that can be of any type for any pokemon. This means that obvious weakness can be anticipated by my rival.\n",
