Thanks to White Herb resetting Arcanine\\'s Special Attack, it can hit the likes of <a href=\"/dex/rs/pokemon/zapdos/doubles/\" hreflang=\"en\">Zapdos</a> and <a href=\"/dex/rs/pokemon/raikou/doubles/\" hreflang=\"en\">Raikou</a> for 2HKOs without having to switch out.</li>\\n<li>Arcanine\\'s other coverage moves aren\\'t that strong, so it gets value out of using Helping Hand to attempt to turn its partners\\' 2HKOs into OHKOs.</li>\\n<li>Hidden Power Grass allows Arcanine to 2HKO <a href=\"/dex/rs/pokemon/swampert/doubles/\" hreflang=\"en\">Swampert</a>. Extreme Speed is really weak, but it is one of the only forms of priority seen in the tier and can be useful for picking off weakened foes.</li>\\n<li>The given EV Spread allows Arcanine to outspeed Jolly Metagross while OHKOing up to 252 HP Metagross with Overheat. The HP and Defense investment allow it to survive Choice Band <a href=\"/dex/rs/pokemon/tauros/doubles/\" hreflang=\"en\">Tauros</a>\\'s Earthquake, and the remaining EVs are dumped into Special Defense.</li>\\n<li>Arcanine is an excellent lead as it OHKOes Metagross. Arcanine is reliant on Electric-types like Raikou and Zapdos or Grass-types like <a href=\"/dex/rs/pokemon/sceptile/doubles/\" hreflang=\"en\">Sceptile</a> to help threaten Water-types like Swampert, <a href=\"/dex/rs/pokemon/starmie/doubles/\" hreflang=\"en\">Starmie</a>, and <a href=\"/dex/rs/pokemon/suicune/doubles/\" hreflang=\"en\">Suicune</a> that threaten Arcanine with Hydro Pump.

       "Okay, I need to help the user create a Pokémon team that includes Metagross, Arcanine, and Dragonite. The goal is to counter Raikou, Blissey, and Dugtrio.\n",
       "\n",
       "First, let's think about each of these opponents:\n",
       "\n",
       "1. **Raikou**: It's a Fire/Flying type. So, we need something that can handle both Fire and Flying moves.\n",
       "2. **Blissey**: This is a Water/Psychic type. It has high Special Attack but needs to be dealt with in other ways because it might not be weak to common types.\n",
       "3. **Dugtrio**: A Ground type, which is strong against Electric attacks. Also, Dugtrio can cause trouble with its Dig attack.\n",
       "\n",
       "Now, looking at the team:\n",
       "\n",
       "- **Metagross**: It's a Steel/Psychic type. Its abilities are useful for handling various types, including Ghost and Psychic threats.\n",
       "- **Arcanine**: Fire/Fighting type. It can take down other Fire types and has good coverage moves like Close Combat.\n",
       "- **Dragonite**: Dragon/Flying type, which is strong against both Raikou's Fire and Flying attacks.\n",
       "\n",
       "Let me consider each member of the team:\n",
       "\n",
       "1. **Metagross**:\n",
       "   - It resists Electric (from Dugtrio) and can counter Blissey with its Ice or Dark moves.\n",
       "   - Its high Attack stat makes it good for physical coverage.\n",
       "   - The ability \"Intimidate\" is great for reducing opponents' attack.\n",
       "\n",
       "2. **Arcanine**:\n",
       "   - Fire type to deal with Raikou, but also Fighting for coverage against other types.\n",
       "   - Close Combat can hit Dugtrio hard since Ground moves are super effective on it.\n",
       "   - It's a good sweeper after setting up.\n",
       "\n",
       "3. **Dragonite**:\n",
       "   - Dragon/Flying resists Water and Electric, which could be useful against Blissey and Dugtrio.\n",
       "   - With \"Aerilate,\" it can boost its Attack when flying.\n",
       "   - Dragon moves can hit other Dragon types, but since the user wants to counter Raikou, maybe it's more about coverage.\n",
       "\n",
       "For the rest of the team, we need:\n",
       "\n",
       "- **Resistances and Coverage**: Maybe add a Water type like Vaporeon or Jolteon to handle Blissey. Or perhaps something with Ice to hit Dugtrio.\n",
       "  \n",
       "- **Utility**: Maybe a Pokémon with Stealth Rock for setting up entry hazards, which would help against Dugtrio's Dig.\n",
       "\n",
       "- **Other Counters**: Consider a Ghost/Poison type like Gengar or a Ground type like Landorus to handle other threats.\n",
       "\n",
       "Wait, but the user specifically wants Metagross, Arcanine, and Dragonite. So maybe I should focus on ensuring these three are effective against the mentioned opponents.\n",
       "\n",
       "Metagross can take Blissey's Water attacks (maybe not too well), but with Intimidate, it reduces her attack. But Blissey has high Special Attack, so maybe adding a special wall would help.\n",
       "\n",
       "Alternatively, Dragonite can hit Blissey with Ice or Dark moves if it has access to them.\n",
       "\n",
       "But Dragonite doesn't have Dark type by default unless it's a Mega Evolved version. Wait, in standard play without Mega Evolutions, Dragonite is just Dragon/Flying.\n",
       "\n",
       "So perhaps including a Pokémon that can cover Blissey effectively is necessary. Maybe adding something with Ice or Dark moves.\n",
       "\n",
       "Wait, but the user wants a team that includes those three. So maybe the other team members should support them.\n",
       "\n",
       "So, to sum up:\n",
       "\n",
       "- Metagross covers Electric from Dugtrio and Ghost/Psychic threats.\n",
       "- Arcanine deals with Fire and Fighting, taking down Raikou and Dugtrio.\n",
       "- Dragonite counters Raikou with Dragon moves and provides Flying coverage.\n",
       "\n",
       "But Blissey is tricky. She's Water/Psychic, so she can be hit by Ice or Dark moves. So maybe adding a Pokémon that has those types would help. Alternatively, using Metagross's Psychic type to wear her down.\n",
       "\n",
       "Wait, but in the initial response, I suggested Vaporeon as the fourth member, which is Water, but Blissey is Water too. That might not be the best. Maybe better to have an Ice or Dark type.\n",
       "\n",
       "Alternatively, perhaps use Jolteon for Electric coverage and handling Dugtrio.\n",
       "\n",
       "Wait, but Dugtrio is Ground, so it's weak to Electric. So having a strong Electric attacker like Jolteon would help, but since we already have Metagross, which can take some hits, maybe that's okay.\n",
       "\n",
       "Another thought: perhaps including a Ghost/Poison type like Gengar to cover Blissey with Dark moves if possible.\n",
       "\n",
       "Alternatively, adding a Dragon/Ice type for better coverage against Blissey.\n",
       "\n",
       "Hmm, this is getting a bit complicated. Maybe the initial response was on the right track but could be adjusted.\n",
       "\n",
       "Wait, in my initial response, I included Vaporeon and Jolteon as support, but that might not directly counter Blissey well. So maybe adjusting to include something like a Dark type would be better.\n",
       "\n",
       "Alternatively, since Metagross is already on the team, its Ice or Stone moves could hit Blissey effectively if Blissey isn't immune. Wait, Blissey is Water/Psychic, so she's not immune to Ice.\n",
       "\n",
       "So maybe using Metagross's Ice Beam or Stone Edge to take down Blissey would work.\n",
       "\n",
       "In that case, perhaps the team can be:\n",
       "\n",
       "1. Metagross\n",
       "2. Arcanine\n",
       "3. Dragonite\n",
       "4. Vaporeon (for Water coverage and handling other Water types)\n",
       "5. Jolteon (for Electric attacks against Dugtrio)\n",
       "6. Maybe a utility Pokémon like Stealth Rock user or a status healer.\n",
       "\n",
       "Wait, but the user only mentioned including Metagross, Arcanine, and Dragonite. So perhaps I should focus on those three and then select other members to cover weaknesses.\n",
       "\n",
       "Alternatively, maybe it's better to include Jolteon as the fourth member for its Electric attacks, which can take down Dugtrio, since Ground is weak to Electric.\n",
       "\n",
       "So, overall, the team would have:\n",
       "\n",
       "- Metagross: For Steel/Psychic coverage, Intimidate.\n",
       "- Arcanine: For Fire/Fighting, Close Combat.\n",
       "- Dragonite: For Dragon/Flying, Aerilate.\n",
       "- Jolteon: For Electric and handling Dugtrio.\n",
       "- Maybe a Water type like Vaporeon for Blissey.\n",
       "\n",
       "But I think the initial response was good, just maybe tweaking the other members to better handle Blissey with Ice or Dark moves.\n",
       "\n",
       "Alternatively, adding a Pokémon with access to Ice or Dark moves would help. For example, using a Salamence (Dragon/Flying) but that's similar to Dragonite.\n",
       "\n",
       "Wait, perhaps not necessary if Metagross can handle it.\n",
       "\n",
       "In conclusion, the team needs to cover Fire, Flying, Water, and Ground types effectively, which the initial response addresses with Vaporeon and Jolteon. Maybe the user can adjust based on their specific needs or tournament rules.\n",

As you already have Raikou on your team.\\n* Electabuzz (Electric-type)\\n* Metagross's weakness can also be countered by a Fairy-type Pokémon, such as Gallade.\\n\\n**Metagross**\\n\\n* Weakness: Psychic-type moves\\n* Strategy: Use a Steel-type or Rock-type Pokémon with high Defense and HP.\\n\\nRecommended Pokémon:\\n\\n* Metagross itself is already on your team!\\n* Lucario (Steel/Fighting-type)\\n* Tyranitar (Rock-type)\\n\\nConsidering the counter-strategies, I recommend including Umbreon, Gallade, Electabuzz, and possibly a Steel-type Pokémon like Lucario or Tyranitar to effectively counter Blaziken, Swampert, and Metagross.\\n\\nKeep in mind that these are just suggestions, and you may need to adjust your team based on the specific metagame and opponents you're facing.\""

    "Base response to **\"What is a good check for rest/talk raikou?\"**\n",
    "\n",
    "Rest/Talk Raikou is a set that utilizes the combination of Rest and Sleep Talk to provide reliable recovery and the ability to attack even while asleep. To counter or check this Raikou set effectively, you'll want to consider the following options:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Toxic Users: **WRONG**\n",
    "\n",
    "Pokémon that can use Toxic are effective against Rest/Talk Raikou. Poisoning Raikou will bypass its ability to heal off status conditions with Rest.\n",
    "Taunt Users:\n",
    "\n",
    "Pokémon with access to Taunt can prevent Rest/Talk Raikou from using Sleep Talk and healing with Rest. This limits its recovery options and makes it vulnerable to continuous attacks.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Status Inflictors: **WRONG**\n",
    "\n",
    "Pokémon that can inflict status conditions like paralysis or burn can hinder Rest/Talk Raikou's effectiveness. A burned Raikou, for example, will have its Attack stat halved **WRONG! Raikou is a special attacker**, reducing the damage it deals.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Ground-types: \n",
    "\n",
    "Ground-type Pokémon are immune to Raikou's Electric-type STAB moves, and they are often bulky enough to take its attacks. They can then proceed to threaten Raikou with super effective Ground-type moves.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Special Walls:\n",
    "\n",
    "Pokémon with high Special Defense can often handle Raikou's attacks well, even if it manages to get a boost from Calm Mind. Examples include Blissey and Snorlax.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Phazing Moves:\n",
    "\n",
    "Pokémon with phazing moves like Roar or Whirlwind can force Raikou to switch out, disrupting its Rest and Sleep Talk cycle. Skarmory is a notable example with access to Whirlwind.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Pressure Pokémon:\n",
    "\n",
    "Pokémon with the ability Pressure can increase the PP consumption of Raikou's moves, potentially causing it to run out of viable options more quickly.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Critical Hits:\n",
    "\n",
    "Moves that increase the likelihood of scoring critical hits, such as Focus Energy or Dire Hit, can help bypass Raikou's increased Defense from Calm Mind.\n",
    "Remember to adapt your strategy based on the specific moves and sets that Raikou carries, as individual Raikou sets may have variations in their movesets and coverage moves. Teaming up with a variety of these options can provide a solid check against Rest/Talk Raikou in different "

However, it should be noted that a Skarmory with RestTalk or Heal Bell support can prevent this strategy from working. Pokemon such as <a href=\"/dex/gs/pokemon/rhydon\" hreflang=\"en\">Rhydon</a>, <a href=\"/dex/gs/pokemon/exeggutor\" hreflang=\"en\">Exeggutor</a>, and Tyranitar are all crippled by status, so using Blissey alongside them can allow them to take risks they might normally be severely punished for.

It is most effective when the opponent is not expecting it, although even after it has been revealed, the opponent will be hard-pressed to take Blissey down without resorting to physical attacks, which can make Blissey quite awkward to deal with for more offensive teams. Unfortunately, Counter is incompatible with Heal Bell, which leaves Counter Blissey rather susceptible to status and inhibits its ability to pose a longer term threat against defensive teams whether it runs Soft-Boiled or not. Lastly, while it might seem like an alien idea to drop Soft-Boiled, Blissey\\\\'s huge special bulk and its Leftovers can allow it to last a surprisingly long time even without its trademark healing move, and if Blissey manages to catch just one Pokemon with Counter, the opponent will often be at a large disadvantage.</p>\\\\n<h1>Team Options</h1>\\\\n<p>Counter Blissey fits less well on ultra-defensive teams and is instead best placed alongside powerful attackers that can take better advantage of the status inflictions and forced switches it can provide.\",\n",
       "  'Some of these include Snorlax, Marowak, and Machamp; however, there are many possible options available. It is important to be able to deal with or threaten Curse Snorlax, as while Counter Blissey can dissuade it from attacking immediately, Blissey can do little to prevent it from setting up. Machamp is one of the only Pokemon that can offensively threaten a Curse-boosted Snorlax and greatly benefits from Counter Blissey\\\\\\'s ability to discourage unboosted Snorlax from hitting it as it switches in. Phazers such as Steelix, <a href=\"/dex/gs/pokemon/rhydon\" hreflang=\"en\">Rhydon</a>, and Skarmory can also deal with Curse Snorlax with varying degrees of effectiveness depending on Snorlax\\\\\\'s coverage attacks. These Pokemon also benefit from Blissey\\\\\\'s ability to paralyze Snorlax, since they will outspeed a paralyzed Snorlax after setting up their own Curse boosts. Machamp is another Pokemon that is critical for a Blissey team to be able to handle, as it is one of the only Pokemon that can take out Blissey with a single unboosted attack other than Explosion and Self-Destruct.

Clamp traps the foe and ensures that Explosion cannot be avoided, and it can work well in tandem with Screech, which enables Cloyster to ideally trap a target like <a href=\"/dex/gs/pokemon/snorlax\" hreflang=\"en\">Snorlax</a>, nullify its Defense boosts from Curse, and remove it from the game.

Although far less common, Rapid Spin Tentacruel might be even better than Starmie at preventing Cloyster from keeping Spikes up, since its immunity to Toxic means that Cloyster can\\\\\\'t do anything against it bar Explosion.

The added residual damage can be very effective when coupled with Spikes.

Other notable Pokemon that can exploit Spikes include phazers, especially those with a significant offensive presence like Raikou and Rhydon. Other forms of residual damage pair nicely with Spikes, since they wear down the opposing team even quicker, so various Toxic and Thief users like Nidoking, <a href=\"/dex/gs/pokemon/exeggutor\" hreflang=\"en\">Exeggutor</a>, Gengar, Misdreavus, and <a href=\"/dex/gs/pokemon/jynx\" hreflang=\"en\">Jynx</a> do well alongside Cloyster.

Kabutops can also realistically sweep an entire opposing team if it manages to acquire the fabled Ancient Power boost, which allows it to survive various attacks, boosts both its physical and special attacks, and allows it to outspeed literally all unboosted foes.

This makes Lugia a very valuable defensive piece for a lot of teams that can also work as a potential wincon. Its monstruous Special Defense also lets it avoid the 2HKO from every non-STAB Thunder, meaning only Pokemon like <a href=\"/dex/gs/pokemon/zapdos\" hreflang=\"en\">Zapdos</a> and <a href=\"/dex/gs/pokemon/jolteon\" hreflang=\"en\">Jolteon</a> can consistently 2HKO it with unboosted attacks.

The alternative is Hidden Power Bug, which can be chosen to deal massive damage to the tier\\\\\\'s numerous strong Psychic-type Pokemon, including <a href=\"/dex/gs/pokemon/slowbro\" hreflang=\"en\">Slowbro</a>, <a href=\"/dex/gs/pokemon/hypno\" hreflang=\"en\">Hypno</a>, <a href=\"/dex/gs/pokemon/mr-mime\" hreflang=\"en\">Mr. Mime</a>, and <a href=\"/dex/gs/pokemon/kadabra\" hreflang=\"en\">Kadabra</a>, while also offering a small boost in power against neutral targets like <a href=\"/dex/gs/pokemon/granbull\" hreflang=\"en\">Granbull</a> and <a href=\"/dex/gs/pokemon/piloswine\" hreflang=\"en\">Piloswine</a>.',\n",
       "  'However, choosing Hidden Power Bug means Scyther will be unable to hit Magneton and will miss out on numerous 2HKOs listed above. When matched up against such foes and in many other cases, Scyther\\\\\\'s best choice may be to Baton Pass its boosts to a teammate such as Nidoqueen, <a href=\"/dex/gs/pokemon/dodrio\" hreflang=\"en\">Dodrio</a>, Granbull, <a href=\"/dex/gs/pokemon/gyarados\" hreflang=\"en\">Gyarados</a>, <a href=\"/dex/gs/pokemon/quagsire\" hreflang=\"en\">Quagsire</a>, or Kabutops. These Pokemon can greatly benefit from the additional Attack boost, which may allow them to break past their usual checks. Baton Pass is also great for scouting what Pokemon the opponent might switch into Scyther and reacting accordingly, since it will usually go first due to Scyther\\\\\\'s Speed if the foe stays in and will go after the switch if it doesn\\\\\\'t.</p>\\\\n<h1>Team Options</h1>\\\\n<p>Nidoqueen makes for a good teammate for Scyther thanks to the pair\\\\\\'s good typing synergy\\x97Scyther is immune to Ground and makes for an excellent pivot with Baton Pass, whereas Nidoqueen easily takes any Rock- and Electric-type moves aimed at Scyther. Furthermore, Nidoqueen benefits from being passed one or more Swords Dance boosts, which can allow it to get past its usual checks like Granbull and Slowbro.',\n",
       "  \"Many Pokemon will try to make Scyther easier to handle by paralyzing it with Thunder Wave or Stun Spore, so it can be helpful to use a Pokemon that can take status moves well such as RestTalk Slowbro or RestTalk Hypno, both of which also happen to serve as decent Nidoqueen checks. Other Hypno sets also make for great status spreaders and supporters in general thanks to Hypno\\\\'s access to Light Screen, Thunder Wave, and Hypnosis. Ampharos is another option for Light Screen support; it can also draw in Ground-types such as Nidoqueen as it sets up the screen, which can give Scyther an opportunity to come in on Earthquake. Granbull, particularly a variant with a coverage move, stands to benefit greatly as a Swords Dance recipient, as almost no Pokemon can take boosted attacks from it for long. Dodrio is likewise an enormous threat when passed a Swords Dance boost, especially considering it outspeeds Qwilfish, one of the tier\\\\'s most prevalent Haze users. Quagsire and Piloswine are other good Swords Dance receivers that double as Electric-type checks. Gyarados and Kabutops can also become much more challenging to take on once passed Attack boosts from Scyther.\",\n",
       "  'Pokemon with Explosion such as Haunter and <a href=\"/dex/gs/pokemon/electrode\" hreflang=\"en\">Electrode</a> can be useful for their ability to break through or weaken some of Scyther\\\\\\'s checks, such as Nidoqueen, Piloswine, <a href=\"/dex/gs/pokemon/sandslash\" hreflang=\"en\">Sandslash</a>, and Quagsire; they can also support it with screens and status moves. Mr. Mime and Jumpluff are also great at easing setup for Scyther with their status moves and access to screens, and they can also use Encore to lock foes into moves that Scyther can easily switch into.',\n",
