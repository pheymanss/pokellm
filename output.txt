This is the connection string to a database: postgresql://postgres:33223322@localhost:5432/pokellm
This database has a schema called mechanics that contains tables relevant for key mechanics in the pokemon games, especifically Generation 3 Ruby/Sapphire/Emerald. The tables are the following:

- pokemon: contains information about the pokemons, mainly stats, abilities and typing. Columns: name, hp, atk, def, spa, spd, spe, weight, height, type1, type2, ability1, ability2, parsed_name. 
- The stats are as follows: HP is the health points, the amount of damage a pokemon can take before fainting. Attack is the stat that determines the power of physical moves. Defense is the stat that determines how much damage a pokemon takes from physical moves. Special Attack is the stat that determines the power of special moves. Special Defense is the stat that determines how much damage a pokemon takes from special moves. Speed is the stat that determines which pokemon moves first in a turn. The higher the speed, the faster the pokemon. This is key to determine a good strategy in battle.
- natures: contains information about natures and their effects. Don't worry about this for now. Columns: name, hp, atk, def, spa, spd, spe, summary
- abilities: name, description
- moveflags
- types: type effectiveness chart. This will help you understand if a type is super effective vs a pokemon. Be aware that the effectiveness is a multiplier, so 2 means super effective, 0.5 means not very effective and 0 means no effect. Also be aware that pokemons can have two types so make sure to take that into account. Columns: name, defend_type, type_effectiveness
- items: name, description
- learnsets: Contains information about the moves that each pokemon can learn, mainly their type, power, accuracy, PP and effects. Columns: pokemon, move, category, power, accuracy, priority, pp, description, type, target.

Also consider:
- Type advantages go both ways. I want pokemon that can resist Typhlosion's moves and also be able to hit it super effectively.
- There are two types of attacks: physical and special. The damage of a physical attack is calculated using the attacker's attack and the defender's defense, 
while the damage of a special attack is calculated using the attacker's special attack and the defender's special defense.
- Speed is the stat that determines which pokemon moves first in a turn. The higher the speed, the faster the pokemon. This is key to determine a good strategy in battle.
- Abilities are passive effects that can help a pokemon in battle. Some abilities can change the outcome of a battle.
- There is a special move called Hidden Power that can be of any type for any pokemon. This means that obvious weakness can be anticipated by my rival.
- Same type attack bonus (STAB) which is a 1.5 multiplier if the move's type is the same as the pokemon's type.

Make sure to use the learnsets table to suggest moves that each pokemon can learn. This is ectremely important to make your suggestions meaningful.

Ue all this information to help the team building process for 6 v 6 singles format:

I am facing Typhlosion and want to know how can I approach the battle if I have a Metagross, an Electrode, an Umbreon, a Slowking an Arcanine and a Dragonite.

Be sure to TERMINATE the conversation when you feel that you cannot provide any more useful information.

Okay, I will analyze your team composition against a Typhlosion and provide insights based on the database information. I will focus on type matchups, potential movesets, and key stats to help you strategize.

First, I need to gather information about Typhlosion's type and potential moves. Then, I'll analyze each of your Pokemon against Typhlosion.

Based on the information gathered:

*   **Typhlosion:** Fire type. Common moves include Flamethrower (Fire, Special), Earthquake (Ground, Physical), and potentially Hidden Power (various types).

*   **Metagross:** Steel/Psychic. High Attack and Defense. Can learn Earthquake, Meteor Mash (Steel), Psychic. Resists Fire.

*   **Electrode:** Electric. Extremely high Speed, but low defenses. Can learn Thunderbolt (Electric), Explosion (Normal).

*   **Umbreon:** Dark. High Special Defense. Can learn moves like Toxic (Poison), Moonlight (Normal), and Dark Pulse (Dark).

*   **Slowking:** Water/Psychic. High Special Attack and Special Defense. Can learn Surf (Water), Psychic (Psychic), and Calm Mind (Psychic).

*   **Arcanine:** Fire. High Attack and Speed. Can learn moves like Flare Blitz (Fire), Extreme Speed (Normal), and Wild Charge (Electric).

*   **Dragonite:** Dragon/Flying. High Attack and Special Attack. Can learn Earthquake, Outrage (Dragon), and Thunderbolt.

Now, let's analyze how each Pokemon fares against Typhlosion:

*   **Metagross:** Resists Fire-type moves. Can hit Typhlosion with Earthquake for super-effective damage. A strong choice.

*   **Electrode:** Can outspeed Typhlosion. Thunderbolt is neutral damage. Explosion is a risky but potentially powerful option.

*   **Umbreon:** Resists Dark moves Typhlosion might have (unlikely, but possible). Can use Toxic to wear down Typhlosion, but has low offensive presence.

*   **Slowking:** Can take a special hit. Surf is neutral damage. Psychic is also neutral.

*   **Arcanine:** Fire vs. Fire is neutral. Flare Blitz is a powerful STAB move, but Arcanine will take recoil damage.

*   **Dragonite:** Resists Fire. Earthquake is a good option for super-effective damage.

**Strategy:**

*   **Metagross:** Your best bet. Earthquake will deal significant damage.
*   **Dragonite:** Another good option with Earthquake.
*   **Electrode:** Can be a revenge killer with its high speed, but is very frail.
*   **Umbreon:** Can stall with Toxic, but is a passive Pokemon.
*   **Slowking:** Can take special hits, but doesn't have a strong offensive presence against Typhlosion.
*   **Arcanine:** Risky due to the Fire-type matchup and Flare Blitz recoil.

I can provide more detailed analysis of specific move combinations or type matchups if you have further questions.

Okay, with the detailed move information, I can refine the strategy.

*   **Metagross:** Earthquake is still the best option. Meteor Mash is a STAB move, but Fire resists Steel. Shadow Ball is a coverage move, but Typhlosion's Special Defense is decent. Agility can help Metagross outspeed.

*   **Electrode:** Electrode's movepool is limited. Thunderbolt is the best STAB option, but it's not super effective. Explosion is a last resort. Taunt can prevent Typhlosion from using stat-boosting moves.

*   **Umbreon:** Toxic is still a viable strategy. Moonlight provides recovery. Shadow Ball is an option for some damage, but Umbreon's Special Attack is low.

*   **Slowking:** Surf and Psychic are the best offensive options, but neither is super effective. Calm Mind can boost Slowking's Special Attack and Special Defense. Earthquake is an option for coverage.

*   **Arcanine:** Flare Blitz is a powerful STAB move, but the recoil is a significant drawback. Extreme Speed is a priority move for finishing off weakened opponents.

*   **Dragonite:** Earthquake is still a good option. Outrage is a powerful STAB move, but it locks Dragonite into the move for 2-3 turns and causes confusion afterward. Thunderbolt provides coverage against Water-types that might switch in. Dragon Dance can boost Dragonite's Attack and Speed.

**Revised Strategy:**

*   **Metagross:** Lead with Metagross. Earthquake is the primary attack. Meteor Mash can be used if Earthquake isn't an option. Agility can be used to outspeed.
*   **Dragonite:** A strong secondary attacker. Earthquake is a good option. Dragon Dance can set up for a sweep.
*   **Electrode:** Use as a revenge killer or a last-ditch effort with Explosion. Taunt can disrupt Typhlosion's strategy.
*   **Umbreon:** Use as a staller with Toxic and Moonlight.
*   **Slowking:** Can be used as a special wall and can deal some damage with Surf or Psychic. Calm Mind can boost its stats.
*   **Arcanine:** Use with caution due to the Fire-type matchup. Extreme Speed can be useful for finishing off weakened opponents.

Considering Typhlosion's potential moves, be wary of Earthquake. Dragonite and Arcanine are particularly vulnerable.

I believe I have provided sufficient information to help you strategize against Typhlosion with your current team. I will now terminate the conversation.
